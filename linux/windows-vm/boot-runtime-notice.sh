# Post-install notice: warn when a package upgrade left the Windows VM GRUB
# boot runtime on the previous version.
#
# `pz windows-vm boot install` copies a self-contained runtime into
# /usr/local/lib/phasezero so the boot session works before the user's home or
# repo is mounted. No package manager owns that copy, so upgrading the PhaseZero
# package silently leaves the GRUB boot path executing the previous release.
#
# This deliberately only warns. Re-running `boot install` regenerates grub.cfg,
# runs os-prober and reconfigures Samba shares; none of that belongs inside a
# package transaction, where a failure would abort the upgrade and a partially
# rewritten bootloader is far worse than an outdated runtime.
#
# Never fails the transaction: an inconclusive probe is silent, and a missing
# dependency exits 0.

>>> PhaseZero: the Windows VM GRUB boot runtime is now OUTDATED.
    /usr/local/lib/phasezero still holds the previous release, so booting
    through the "PhaseZero Windows VM" GRUB entry runs the old code.

    Resync it with admin rights:

        phasezero-admin $PZ_LIB/linux/pz windows-vm boot install

    Check at any time, no privileges needed:

        $PZ_LIB/linux/pz windows-vm boot runtime-check
